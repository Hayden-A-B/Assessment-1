        <h2>Personal Information</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Hayden Bleys and I am a Cheesemaker and part-time student enrolled in a Bachelor of Information Technology at <abbr title="Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology">RMIT</abbr>, and have been a cheesemaker in my current employment since March 2021 but began my career of working in cheesemaking back in 2016. In addition to working I began studying <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> in November of this year which is the first time I have undertaken formal study since completing high school in the year 2013.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wondai is the town I was born in, it is a small historic town approximately 250km north-west of Brisbane, and have spent a large portion of my life living in the region around Wondai as well as living in Brisbane and the Gold Coast in recent years. My family has been living in the south-eastern Queensland regions since the 19th century after my ancestors migrated from England and the Netherlands on my mother’s and father’s side of the family respectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have an interest in Australian history from the colonial period up to the World Wars which I like to learn about from books, online sources, and oral records.

  <!---- Interest in IT ---->
    <div class="box">
        <h2>Interest in IT </h2>
            <p>
                When I was studying in high school, I didn’t have a determined path for my studies to take me and was more interested in playing around with computer games and enjoyed fiddling with game mods to alter the way the games work. Over time I developed a deeper interest in the way things work first with my car understanding the way the components operate in conjunction to each other, and then the workings of my computer, making repairs and modifications myself. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In relation to information technology, I have installed new operating systems, assembled brand new Computers from scratch, performed diagnosis of hardware malfunctions and rectified via software or replacement of faulty parts.
            </p>
            <p>
                I chose to study at RMIT as they offer an online degree through Open Universities Australia and the flexibility of online study will fit into my schedule better whilst I work fulltime. My decision to study came about as I am finding being employed in a labour industry increasingly arduous, and a career in IT seems the most suitable in regards to what I am passionate about.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through RMIT I would like to learn skills that will help me gain employment in the IT sector, such as knowledge of coding languages, systems administration knowledge, and mobile software development.

        <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p>
                The role entails working on important applications with minimal room for error. The option of having a combination of days in office and working from home interests me, as well as the prospective challenge the position may likely hold.
            </p>
<!------ - - - ------>
        <h3>Desired Skills:</h3>
            <p>
                The position requires knowledge of programming languages: C and C++ on Linux, a relevant degree, and experience using workflow and collaboration applications.
            </p>
<!------ - - - ------>
        <h3>Skills I Possess:</h3>
            <p>
                I have rudimentary knowledge of HTML and CSS, but ultimately lack the required experience with C/C++ programming languages and Linux experience.
            </p>
<!------ - - - ------>
    <h3>Learning Plan:</h3>
            <p>
                Completing my degree will be the most substantial step towards becoming qualified for a role like this in the future, and using resources such as online coding courses to become more familiar with common programming languages. In the future I will apply for junior software engineering positions to gain relevant work experience perhaps even during my final years of studying towards a degree.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a team setting I might be picked to plan a guideline and for analysis of the project during its stages of development.

        <h3>16 Personalities</h3>
            <p>
                I believe the type of Architect and role of Analyst are quite apt as in my own life I tend to put an emphasis on planning my projects and arranging a roadmap for projects. When I encounter many things, I often ask myself why it was done this way and how could it be done better. These traits have helped me in my career as I have an aptitude for making refinements to existing procedures or creating new more optimized ones.

        <h3>Emtrain Learning Styles</h3>
            <p>
                According to the Emtrain Learning styles test I am predominantly a Theorist-Reflector style learner, these results seem to add weight to the 16 Personalities results: Architect/Analyst. I find as a theorist I like to try and learn and familiarise myself with a project before making a beginning then following a procedure for completing it, and then when completed I reflect upon how successful it was and whether it could have been improved in any way.

        <h3>Big Five Factor Markers</h3>
            <p>
                The Extroversion, Emotional stability, and Agreeableness factors reflect that I am very objective in interactions with other people, skipping over small talk I will cut straight to the point and can be very critical which sometimes people may misconstrue as rudeness. To compensate I try to be as polite and considerate as possible. Whilst Conscientiousness and Intellect/Imagination factors are displayed by my meticulousness in that I rarely make the same mistake twice and constantly seek self-improvement and improvement of systems around me.

  <!-- Project Ideas -->
    <div class="box">
        <h2>Project Ideas</h2>
        <!------ - - - ------>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    <i>Digital Smart Calendar with possibilities for personal, business or public utilization.</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    You could have multiple digital calendars which can all be updated simultaneously from a single control point such as a computer running a synced application or simply leave it without any syncing and input calendar events from the device directly using either touchscreen input or speech to text. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A major use would be for vision impaired people as the device would have full voice control and can read aloud weekly events, tell you what day or time it is and similar features when asked via verbal commands.
                </p>
        <!------ - - - ------>
            <h3>Motivation</h3>
                <p>
                    The Digital Smart Calendar would be a way of sharing events with household members or for business settings.
                    In a home setting a Smart Calendar would allow people to view another person’s schedule 
                    Being like a standard tablet but having a narrowly defined use case will allow unnecessary functions to be left out so that the cost and complexity of design can be reduced.

                </p>
        <!------ - - - ------>
            <h3>Description </h3>
                <p>
                    It would be asleep while not in use and may be motion sensor activated when someone walks a metre in front of it or turned on when someone turns on their smart lights. Options would allow the calendar to be a standalone product or able to sync with another calendar service or multiple services to serve as a central calendar for a collective of people.
                </p>
        <!------ - - - ------>
            <h3>Features</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Standby would display a monthly overview and notes for daily events and icons indicating there are hidden events of lesser priority.</li>

                    <li>Modes for read only so that the calendar can be put on display in a public area.</li>
                    <li>Motion sensor activated, triggered when a room is ‘active’ possibly determined by the lights being turned on.</li>
                    <li>Standalone or syncing with major calendar apps and todo lists (e.g., Google, Apple, and Microsoft)</li>
                    <li>To-do/shopping list.</li>
